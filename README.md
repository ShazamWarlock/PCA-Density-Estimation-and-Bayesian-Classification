# PCA-Density-Estimation-and-Bayesian-Classification
In this project, we aim to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Density Estimation and
Bayesian Classification techniques on a dataset.
The project uses a subset of images (with modifications) from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The
original Fashion-MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of objects, divided into 60,000 training
images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset we use has two classes: “T-shirt” (or class 0 as we
decide to call it) and class “Sneaker” (or class 1). The data is stored in “.mat” files. In the
original .mat file, each image is stored as a 28x28 array.
We aim to extract this data, make it suitable to work on (using PCA), perform analysis on it
(estimate density of classes) and predict our output (using Bayes classification and minimum
error rate calculation) based on our study of the data.
